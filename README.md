# WBC-Classification
This Project is about classification the white blood cell into it's 4 types LYMPHOCYTE , EOSINOPHIL , MONOCYTE , NEUTROPHIL
Dataset Link on kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/blood-cells  (dataset-master2)
I didn't take in account the Red Blood cells and Palletes found in the image, I just PreProcessed the image so that I found
the targeted cell in the image (WHITE BLOOD CELL) and ignored the rest
although the preprocessing step wasn't mine but thanks to a user on kaggle I managed to get things done
